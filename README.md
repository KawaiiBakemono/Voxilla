# Voxilla
A feature-full Minecraft resourcepack that aims to improve consistency, clarity, and visibility while keeping the vanilla feel! 

This pack mainly changes textures I don't like, are inconsistent, or to improve the overall quality of life. Everything on my profile marked as discontinued has most likely just migrated here! I won't update those packs any longer, but small subpacks for certain features might become a thing. Future updates will come out, be it bug fixes or new features, so stay tuned! I recommend using this alongside Stormilla, it was built with it in mind because I use it personally!

Some features require OptiFine or Fabric alternatives (such as emissive textures), but the pack will work regardless! Not everything is shown in the images, but there is a full features list below!

Feel free to PM me or leave a comment for bugs, feedback, and suggestions!

## What's coming in 1.2?
