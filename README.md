# Voxilla

Current version: 1.2.0

#### DISCLAIMER: Some features require OptiFine or Fabric alternatives, but the pack should work regardless! I've tried to add vanilla fallbacks for most features that require it. 

This is the official pack repository for Voxilla; a feature-full Minecraft resourcepack that aims to improve consistency, clarity, and visibility while keeping the vanilla feel! 

This pack mainly changes textures I don't like, are inconsistent, or to improve the overall quality of life. I have currently a huge 2.0.0 version in the works, focusing on the GUI, 3D foliage, bushy leaves, brand new fireworks, and much more! 

Feel free to report any bugs or leave suggestions in the [Issues](https://github.com/LunaBytes/Voxilla/issues) tab.
Check out more of my packs at [KawaiiBakemono](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/kawaiibakemono/) on Planet Minecraft!

## Goals for this pack
- Fix any inconsistencies (ex. Pixel inconsistency on entities, palette inconsistencies on same-type blocks)
- Improve clarity and no copy-paste (ex. Giving each Command Block and state unique distinguishable textures)
- Improve the overall quality of life gameplay (ex. Adding icons to the menus for easier access, color-coded text)

## How to Install (Windows)
- Click the link and download the pack from the Google Drive.
- Press `Win + R`, it should open a Run window.
- Enter `%appdata%\.minecraft` and click Ok. In the `.minecraft` folder, find and open the folder called `resourcepacks`.
- Copy the `Voxilla-vX.X.X.zip` you just downloaded into `resourcepacks`.
- In-game, click Settings then Resourcepacks and select the pack.
- Click Done and you should be good to go!
